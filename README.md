# SSELauncher comfy edition - Reupload

[**Download latest working build (with bundled 1.4.3 SSE + LifeSupport)**](https://github.com/VistaOnTen2007/SSEComfy/blob/main/SmartSteamEmuComfy.zip)

Based on decompiled source of SSELauncher contained in [SmartSteamEmu **1.4.3** release](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=62935), slightly cleaned up but mostly untouched.

## Added features:
* Log cleaning on startup
* Per game debug logging switch
* DLC list import from clipboard using the "dlc id=name" format found in most emulators.
* DLC list clearing
* LifeSupport Plugin (may not work on some games).
* Now comes with SSE 1.4.3 by default.
